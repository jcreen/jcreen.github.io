                        <h2>Education</h2>
                        <p>Bachelor of Arts in Elementary Education</p>
                        
                        <h2>Philosophy of Education</h2>
                        <p>I believe each and every child has the potential to bring something unique and special to the world. 
                            All children are lifelong learners who need a secure, caring, and stimulating environment in which they
                             can reach their fullest potential. Education is the window of opportunity for students to explore their 
                             personal interest and improve their wealth of knowledge.</p>
                    <h2>Personal Statement</h2>
                    <p>This is my 14th year in education and I am still excited about learning and teaching. There is nothing more 
                        rewarding than setting goals with students, parents, colleagues and working collaboratively to reach them. I 
                        am indebted to my elementary school teachers for cultivating my desire to learn and feel and obligation to pay
                         it forward with my students. I obtained my Level 1 Google Educator Certification in September of 2016 and have 
                         attended several technology focused conferences. Teaching is a way of life for me and I find that even in my 
                         spare time I am thinking of ways to enhance my studentâ€™s learning experience.  I am blessed with a very supportive 
                         family that continues to encourage me as a lifelong learner.  I enjoy spending time with my husband, Ben, and my 
                         daughters, Zoe, Abigail and our Isabelle.  I enjoy going to church, and visiting all the hometown attractions that 
                         St. Louis has to offer.  I also enjoy swimming, scuba diving, camping, reading, and traveling.</p>
